Composition in Java

The composition is another form of aggregation which is considered as the restricted form of Association.

In this type of association, the entities are completely dependent on each other, unlike the aggregation. Composition allows for one-to-many relationships between objects.

It represents a part-of relationship between two objects. One entity cannot exist without the other. Composition in Java represents a one-to-many relationship.

Suppose, there is a House and inside the house, there are many rooms. We consider the relationship between the house and the rooms.

A single house can have multiple rooms but a single room can not have multiple houses. And, if we delete the house, the rooms will automatically be deleted.

So the two entities: house and rooms, are dependent on each other. Room is a part of the House and they two hold a relation of composition.
