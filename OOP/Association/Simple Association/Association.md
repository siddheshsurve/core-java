What is Association in Java?
Association in Java is one of the building blocks and the most basic concept of object-oriented programming. Association is a connection or relationship between two separate classes.

It shows how objects of two classes are associated with each other. The Association defines the multiplicity between objects. We can describe the Association as a has-a relationship between the classes.

Association is a kind of relationship between classes whose objects have an independent lifecycle and there is no ownership between the objects. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.

Let’s take a real-life example to understand these types:

1. One-to-one
The best example of a one-to-one association is that one person or one individual can have only one passport. This is a one-to-one relationship between the person and the passport.

2. One-to-many
Suppose, there is a Doctor and his patients. So, one doctor is associated with many patients. So this is an example of a one-to-many Association between a doctor and patients.

3. Many-to-one
For example, there can be many books in one library, each book is associated with that library, and it can’t be a part of another library. So, many books are related to one library.

This is an example of a many-to-one Association between books and a library.

4. Many-to-many
If we talk about a teacher and student, there can be many students associated with one teacher, and also, the teacher can be related to many students.

So, the relationship between a teacher and student can be many-to-many.

Types of Java Association
There are two special forms of Association in Java. They are:
1. Composition
2. Aggregation
